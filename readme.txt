Hello Everyone! This website was one of the first group projects that I had completed on the Google CSSI Program. It showcases awesome recipes with a cool serving-to-recipe customization feature. The site also includes a bookstore where you can "buy" the 4 versions of our book! More updates to come regarding functionality.
